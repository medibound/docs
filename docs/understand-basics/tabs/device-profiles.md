# Device Profiles

A Device Profile is a comprehensive blueprint that defines how a medical device operates, communicates, and integrates within the Medibound ecosystem. It serves as the foundation for device management, data collection, and system integration.

## What is a Device Profile?

A Device Profile is a structured representation that includes:

- Device specifications and capabilities
- Communication protocols and interfaces
- Data formats and schemas
- Security requirements
- Operational parameters
- Compliance certifications

## Device Profile Components
